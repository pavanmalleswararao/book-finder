Book Finder Application Details
User Persona: Alex, a college student who needs to find, organize, and reference books for their studies.

Application Overview
The Book Finder application is a web-based tool designed to help Alex quickly search for books and manage their research. It features a clean, responsive interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Key Features
Book Search: The core of the application. Alex can search for any book by title using the Open Library Search API. The results show the book's title, author, and cover art.

Search History: The application automatically saves a list of Alex's recent search queries. This is useful for quickly revisiting past topics.

Favorites: Alex can mark any book as a "favorite" by clicking the star icon. This allows them to create a personalized reading list for assignments or personal interest. The list is accessible via a dedicated "Favorites" button.

Recently Viewed: The app keeps a running list of the last books Alex has clicked on.

Implemented Features & Updates
This section details the specific features that have been implemented in the application as a solution to the "Take-Home Challenge" requirements.

Initial Core Functionality: The application was first built with core features, including book search, a responsive user interface, and the ability to add books to a favorites list.

Search History: A search history feature was added, allowing the application to save recent search terms to the browser's local storage. This enabled Alex to revisit previous searches easily.

Individual History Item Removal: A clickable "x" icon was added next to each search history item. Clicking this icon removes only that specific item from the history list, providing more granular control over the stored searches.

Recently Viewed List: A dedicated "Recently Viewed" section was created. This list automatically saves and displays the last ten books Alex has interacted with.

Recents Management and Timestamps: To improve the "Recently Viewed" feature, a timestamp for the last view was added to each book in the list. A "Clear Recents" button was also implemented, giving Alex the option to clear the entire list with a single click. Both the list and the timestamps are saved to local storage for persistence.

Technical Implementation
Front-End: The application is built using React to provide a dynamic and responsive user experience. All components and styling are contained within a single App.jsx file for simplicity.

Styling: A separate App.css file is used to provide a modern, clean design.

API: The application uses the Open Library Search API to fetch book data. Specifically, it sends a GET request to the following endpoint:
https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q={searchQuery}

State Management: The application uses React's useState hook to manage the state of the search query, book results, favorites, recents, and search history.

Data Persistence: Browser's localStorage is used to save and retrieve the user's search history and recently viewed books, ensuring the data persists between sessions.

Event Handling: Event listeners are implemented to handle user interactions such as form submissions, button clicks, and onFocus/onBlur for the search input. The e.stopPropagation() method is used to prevent child element events from bubbling up and affecting parent elements, ensuring, for example, that clicking the "x" on a history item does not trigger a search.

Conclusion
The final version of this application successfully meets all the specified user needs and general guidelines from the "Take-Home Challenge" document. It provides a functional, user-friendly, and responsive solution for a college student's book-finding needs.
